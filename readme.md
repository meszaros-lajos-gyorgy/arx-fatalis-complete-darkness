## Disclaimers

### Loading savefiles

Torches will not be turned off, if you load an existing savefile. If you want torches to be turned
off by default, then start a new game.

### Some levels are work in progress, as changing the LLF files seem to do nothing

The following levels will not have any changes:

- Level 1 - The City of Arx (level 11)
- Level 2 - The Akbaa temple (level 14)
- Level 4 - The underground Lake (level 3)
- Level 7 - The Mushroom Forest (level 6)
- Level 7 - The Crypt, Level 4 (level 22)

### Entities will still glow a bit

It's hardcoded into the game, that can't be changed:
