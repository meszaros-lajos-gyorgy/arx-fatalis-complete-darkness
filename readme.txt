Loading savefiles:

Torches will not be turned off, if you load an existing savefile. If you want torches to be turned
off by default, then start a new game.

Some levels are work in progress, as changing the LLF files seem to not do anything:

The following levels will not have any changes:

Level 1 - The City of Arx (level 11)
Level 2 - The Akbaa temple (level 14)
Level 4 - The underground Lake (level 3)
Level 7 - The Mushroom Forest (level 6)
Level 7 - The Crypt, Level 4 (level 22)

Entities will still glow a bit, but it's hardcoded into the game, that can't be changed
