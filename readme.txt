Version: 1.3

There are 3 different versions:

versions/torch-on.zip - all is dark, but extinguishable torches are left lit
versions/torch-off.zip - all is dark and torches are extinguished
versions/ue4-remake-demake.zip - same as torch-on, but every light is now orange and brighter, and flames are larger

------------
 DISCLAMERS
------------

- Torches will not be turned off, if you reload a savefile and revisit a location, that you have already visited
- Entities will still glow a bit, but it's hardcoded into the game, that can't be changed

--------------
 Installation
--------------

Unpack the contents of this zip and add it into
your Arx Fatalis/Arx Libertatis game's root folder

-----------
